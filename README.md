ricoh-theta-autoit
==================

[AutoIt 3.x](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/) script for batch processing using the [Ricoh Theta for Windows](https://theta360.com/de/support/download/) GUI application. The app can auto-level the panoramic images and add the missing XMP metadata, but it only processes one image at a time by itself.

New maintainer
--------------

The script was originally written by Sven Neuhaus. Ian Felstead is the current maintainer.

Usage
-----

After downloading, edit the script `theta_xmp.au3` to match your setup: search for the "Config Section" and perform the following configuration steps:
* set the path to the installed Ricoh Theta App to match your system (see $theta_exe)
* select the navigation method (how the script controls the App)
* select the appropriate language strings depending on your locale (default is German)

Once configured, copy `theta_xmp.au3` into the directory with your 360Â° panoramic images 
copied from the Ricoh Theta camera. Launch it (usually by double clicking) and
it will scan the directory and - for every JPG image that does not yet have an 
accompanying _xmp.jpg file - generate it using the *Ricoh Theta for Windows* 
application.

The generated files will be **auto-levelled** and contain the **XMP metadata** necessary to
turn the images into photospheres and/or use them with [Mapillary](http://blog.mapillary.com/update/2014/09/10/support-for-pano.html).
